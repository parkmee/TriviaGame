# Trivia Game v1
Trivia questions and answers were stored as objects within a question bank array. All questions are populated dynamically on screen at the start of the game. Guesses must be made in the alloted time period. Scores are tallied at the end of the game, calculating the total number correct, incorrect, unanswered, and the percentage correct.
